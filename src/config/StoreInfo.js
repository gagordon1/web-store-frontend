const INFLATION_DESCRIPTION = "In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money.[4][5] The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services."
